<body>This is the part of the story where we brainstorm ideas and solutions!!
    everytime you get on this page you will start from scratch with a few new options
    <ol>1.make up your own story</ol>
    <ol>2.collaborate with others on a story to make one collage of stories together</ol>
    <ul> With collaborations come more unexpected results but still creative and good to do.</ul>
    <ol>3.pick a story already created and just make your own edits</ol>
    <ul> While this is great to do, careful not to plagurize anyone else's work</ul>
